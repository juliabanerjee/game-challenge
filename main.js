// a)
// Elements:
/* 
- need an interactive whiteboard that you could draw on (HTML canvas?)
- drawing tools ie rubber, colours, thickness of pencil, clear board button
- colours and pencil thickness will need a collapsable bit with the different options. (could forgo pencil thickness if not enough time)
- a word bank that will generate a word to draw from the word bank and not repeat itself during each game
- displayed timer that ends the round when time is up
- 2 different screens for player 1 and 2 (with word revealed and without)
- point scoring if word was guessed, ie 5 if you drew it, 10 if you guessed it
- a box showing what you've already guessed
- advanced a thing in the top bar showing which round it is


Advanced features:

- multiplayer capability ie more than 2
-

Processes:

-EXTRA a way to input player names so that player 1 name chnages to BOB etc
- a start button that starts the rounds, triggers the wordbank and a timer of 2/3 mins
- a board which one player could draw on and the other
- an answerbox that displays on the other players screen or the answerbox gets greyed out depending on who's turn it is to guess (disable property?) with placeholder text
- boolean function as to whether the word guessed matches or not if matches triggers round to stop and change turns with a congrats message





Colour scheme: green main (#0A623D or #78c800#8d0lawngreenhsl(83,100%,39%)rgb(120,200,0)), orange (#FF8811), white (#FFF8F0), purple?
