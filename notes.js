(use in loop to stop and start it)
a) creating an input variable
b) adding eventlistener onto neter button so that input is saved in input variable
c) start writing function to check input against answer
d)function needs an if/else statement and should return a right or wrong message (alert)
e) Get that working for the first inded of the array
f) take out of loop if it doesn't work
